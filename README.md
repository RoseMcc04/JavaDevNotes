# Java Development Notes

JavaDevNotes is my personal collection of Java projects and learning notes. It covers a mix of topics I'm exploring, like data structures and algorithms, working with databases through JDBC, and building UIs with JavaFX. This repo is part reference, part sandbox — a place to practice, experiment, and keep track of what I’ve learned along the way.
